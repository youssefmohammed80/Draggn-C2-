# Dragon C2 — README

🐉 **Dragon C2 — Overview**

**Dragon C2** is a command-and-control framework intended for educational use, authorized red-team engagements, and cybersecurity research. This README describes the project architecture, features, deployment considerations, security guidance, and defensive measures — without providing actionable steps to compromise systems.

---

## Features

- Central GUI dashboard for managing sessions and C2 operations.  
- Payload Generator (conceptual) with options (e.g., standalone package, persistence).  
- File browser for conceptual upload/download/list/delete/execute operations.  
- Shell command area for interacting with active sessions (conceptual; avoid dangerous commands).  
- Quick Actions panel to automate info gathering: system info, network info, processes, logs, screenshots (if permitted).  
- Detailed Logs & Output for activity monitoring and analysis.

---

## High-level Architecture

- **GUI:** Central dashboard with Listener, Payload Generator, Sessions, File Browser, and Logs.  
- **Listener:** Component that accepts inbound connections from agents.  
- **Communication channels:** May be implemented over TCP/HTTP/WebSocket depending on design goals.  
- **Persistence & storage:** Persistent store for sessions, events, and logs (local DB or encrypted files).  
- **Agent components:** Lightweight agent that runs on target hosts (discussion here is conceptual only).

---

## Requirements & Operational Notes (Non-actionable / High-level)

- Host OS capable of running the GUI/server (Windows/Linux depending on implementation).  
- Appropriate runtime (Python/Go/.NET etc.) if applicable.  
- Elevated privileges may be required for some data-collection features — noted for awareness only.  
- Always deploy in isolated lab environments (VMs, segmented networks) for testing.

---

## Safe & Authorized Use Only

- **Purpose:** For defensive research, authorized red-teaming, and security training.  
- **Constraints:** Do not use this framework against systems or networks without explicit, documented authorization.  
- **Training:** Use isolated lab VMs and segmented networks to simulate realistic scenarios safely.

---

## Security & Legal

- Strict legal compliance is required. Always obtain written authorization.  
- Maintain a documented scope, timeline, and rollback plan for engagements.  
- Encrypt logs and communication channels within test environments to prevent data leakage.

## Detection & Mitigation — Contributing to Defense

_This section is useful for blue-teamers improving detection of C2 activity._

### Common Indicators
- Unexpected outbound connections to unusual hosts or ports.  
- Background processes generating periodic beaconing.  
- Unknown executables appearing in startup or persistence locations.  
- Processes capturing screenshots or accessing sensitive logs.

### Detection & Mitigation Tips
- Monitor outbound network traffic with IDS/IPS and look for repetitive connection patterns.  
- Use EDR to monitor process behavior, network calls, and access to sensitive files.  
- Inspect startup items (scheduled tasks, services) for unauthorized changes.  
- Apply least privilege and network segmentation.

---

## Safe Lab Exercises (Suggested)

1. Set up an isolated lab with multiple VMs: control server, target VM, and monitoring VM (SIEM/EDR).  
2. Simulate benign inventory/collection activity and monitor network logs for detection.  
3. Test and evaluate IDS/EDR rules by simulating C2-like patterns in the lab.  

> All exercises are simulation-only and do not include operational exploitation steps.
