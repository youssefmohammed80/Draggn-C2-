# Dragon C2 — Command & Control Framework (Educational / Defensive)

> **Purpose:** Dragon C2 is presented here as an educational / research-oriented command-and-control (C2) framework. The README describes architecture, defensive use-cases, and lab exercises only. It intentionally avoids step-by-step offensive instructions or deployment procedures that could be used to compromise systems without authorization.

## Overview

Dragon C2 is intended as a learning tool for red-team/blue-team exercises, security training, and research. It provides a conceptual GUI dashboard for observing C2 workflows: listeners, payload generation (conceptual), sessions, file browsing, and quick actions for data collection. This repository and documentation are focused on **education, detection, and defensive hardening**.

---

## Features

- Centralized GUI dashboard for monitoring sessions and activity.  
- Conceptual payload generator interface (for lab simulation).  
- Sessions pane for session lifecycle visibility.  
- File browser (UI view) for simulated file operations.  
- Shell/command area for interaction in controlled lab scenarios (non-actionable here).  
- Quick Actions panel (predefined information-gathering tasks for lab scenarios).  
- Detailed logging and output for auditing and analysis.

---

## High-level Architecture

This section explains components at a non-actionable level to help defenders and researchers understand typical C2 patterns.

- **GUI / Control Console:** Single-pane dashboard aggregating listeners, sessions, file browsing, and logs. Useful for visualization in training scenarios.  
- **Listener:** Conceptual component that receives inbound connections from agents/beacons in a lab environment.  
- **Agent (Client):** Lightweight component that, in a controlled lab, simulates endpoint behavior and communicates with the listener. **Deployment instructions are intentionally omitted.**  
- **Transport Channels:** Common options in C2 designs include long-lived TCP, HTTP(s), and WebSocket channels; defenders should monitor all of these for anomalous patterns.  
- **Persistence & Storage:** Session metadata and logs should be stored securely (e.g., encrypted storage) within lab environments.

---

## Requirements & Environment

- Host OS capable of running GUI tools (Windows, Linux, or macOS depending on implementation).  
- Appropriate runtime (Python 3.x, or another runtime if the implementation specifies).  
- Virtualized/isolated network environment (VMs, segmented lab VLANs) strongly recommended for all testing.  
- Monitoring & telemetry (SIEM, EDR, network IDS) available to observe and log test activity.

---

## Safe & Authorized Usage

- **Only use within authorized scope.** Obtain explicit, documented permission from the system owner before running any tests.  
- Use Dragon C2 exclusively inside isolated lab networks or during approved red-team engagements with written rules of engagement (RoE).  
- Avoid running simulations on production systems or networks that contain sensitive data without prior approval and remediation plans.

---

## Security, Compliance & Legal

- Always follow local and international laws — unauthorized access is illegal.  
- Maintain an approved scope of work, escalation contacts, and rollback procedures before beginning tests.  
- Encrypt stored logs and use secure channels for any remote communication inside the lab.  
- Follow a responsible disclosure process for any vulnerabilities discovered during research.

---

## Detection & Mitigation Guidance (for Blue Teams)

This section lists defensive indicators and suggested mitigations to help detect and respond to potential C2-like activity.

### Common Indicators
- Unusual outbound connections to rarely-seen destinations or over uncommon ports.  
- Periodic or scheduled beaconing patterns from endpoints.  
- Unknown binaries appearing in persistence locations or startup entries.  
- Processes performing uncommon activities (screen capture, log access, or network scanning).

### Detection Techniques
- Monitor for periodic, patterned outbound traffic (beacon detection).  
- Correlate process behavior with network telemetry (EDR + network logs).  
- Use YARA-like rules for unusual binaries and hash-based blacklists for known malware.  
- Inspect scheduled tasks, services, and startup entries for unauthorized changes.

### Mitigations
- Implement least privilege and reduce unnecessary administrative rights.  
- Enforce application allowlisting where possible.  
- Deploy EDR with behavioral detection and response playbooks.  
- Segment the network and restrict outbound connections except where required.

---

## Recommended Lab Exercises

All exercises are intended for isolated lab environments only.

1. **Visibility Exercise:** Simulate a benign agent that opens periodic outbound connections; use SIEM to detect and create alerting rules based on frequency and destination.  
2. **Behavioral Detection:** Generate sample process behaviors (file read/write, network call) and tune EDR to trigger on anomalous sequences.  
3. **Rule Development:** Create sample detection rules (Snort/Suricata signatures or Sigma rules) that catch suspicious C2-like traffic patterns.  
4. **Recovery Drill:** Practice rollback and remediation steps after a simulated compromise (isolate host, collect forensic artifacts, recover from backups).

---

## Contributing

- Contributions are welcome for defensive features: detection rules, lab scenarios, documentation improvements, and defensive playbooks.  
- Please use responsible disclosure channels to report issues or potential vulnerabilities.  
- When proposing changes that relate to detection, include test artifacts (in a sanitized form) and clear instructions to reproduce in an isolated lab.

## License

Choose a license that clearly states permitted uses and restrictions. For educational/defensive projects you may consider a license with explicit clauses preventing malicious use (consult legal counsel for exact wording). Example options: MIT with additional terms, or a custom internal license.
